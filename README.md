## Code of Conduct

1. Be nice.
2. Be reasonable. If you're asking me volunteer an hour of my time fixing a bug in a commercial project, I'm going to politely say no and close the issue.
3. Post code and/or examples. Keep things concise and clear. 
4. Be open. Share how you've already approached the problem. If you'd like me to sign an NDA and review private code, [email me](bvdrucker@gmail.com) about consulting agreements.
